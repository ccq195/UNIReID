# Towards Modality-Agnostic Person Re-identification with Descriptive Query CVPR2023

# Highlight
1. This paper start the first attempts to investigate the modality-agnostic person re-identification with the descriptive query.
2. This paper introduces a novel unified person re-identification (UNIReID) architecture based on a dual-encoder to jointly integrate cross-modal and multi-modal task learning. With task-specific modality learning and task-aware dynamic training, UNIReID enhances generalization ability across tasks and domains.
3. This paper contributes three multi-modal ReID datasets to support unified ReID evaluation.

# Dataset
Based on existing text-based datasets (CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid), we collect the sketches from photo modality to obtain multi-modality datasets (Tri-CUHK-PEDES, Tri-ICFG-PEDES, and Tri-RSTPReid).  The collected sketches can be found in: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0h2utqisEx6OzGuoSaQhA (提取码: ndau).
